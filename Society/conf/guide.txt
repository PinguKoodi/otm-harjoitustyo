In this game you play a role of a benevolent leader.
You must guide your citizens to gather resources in four different places. 
The most important one is Farm, where your subjects gather food.
If you run out of food, people will get starve and die.
To boost food production, you may allocate some workers to the Factory.
Tools made in factory will help improve the output of Farm.
Especially, if you have less tools than farmers, your food output is
greatly reduced
Scientist in laboratory will slowly make more Science.
Science will make Factory work more efficiently,
and it is the true measure of your society, so you will be ranked by it.
Remember to keep some soldiers ready, otherwise you may experience severed
resource income, or other dangers.
